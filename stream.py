# Introduction
st.markdown("""
### Hello! I can recommend colleges based on your JEE rank.

**Currently supported:** JEE Mains based recommendations
**Coming soon:** JEE Advanced based recommendations

**New Features:**
- ‚úÖ Shows only colleges where Close Rank ‚â• Your Rank (you can get admission)
- ‚úÖ College State filter for NITs (Home State: HS quota only, Other State: OS quota only)
- ‚úÖ Results sorted by close rank in ascending order (easiest to get first)
- ‚úÖ Complete chat history saved as JSON in local folder
- ‚úÖ No Google Sheets storage - everything saved locally
